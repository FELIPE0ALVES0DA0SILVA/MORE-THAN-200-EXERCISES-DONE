# Create a program that read the name, age and sex of four persons. In the end of the program, show:
# The average of the ages of the group
# Which is the name of the men ore elderly
# How many woman have less than 20 years.

# MAKE FOUR VARIABLES THAT, THREE WILL BE EMPTY INTEGERS AND THE LAST WILL BE EMPTY STRINGS
# MAKE A FOR LOOP OF 1 TO 5 AND COUNT 1 BY 1:
#               CREATE A FLOAT VARIABLE THAT CONTAIN THE AGE OF EACH PERSON PER LOOP:
#               CREATE A VARIABLE BY NAME
#               CREATE A VARIABLE BY SEX
#               MAKE A ITERABLE THAT CONTAIN THE AGE OF ALL PERSONS IN THE END OF THE LOOP FOR
