# Develop a program that read six integers numbers and show the sum only of that were pairs. If the value digit  was odd, disconsider it.

# CREATE TWO VARIABKES THE WILL INOUT ZERO WITH VALUES
# MAKE A FOR LOOP OF 1, 7 AND COUNT OF 1 BY 1:
#           CREATE A VARIABLE THAT INPUT A INTEGER NUMBER
#           IF THIS NUMBER BE PAIR:
#                       MAKE TWO ITERATION, ONE BY SUM OF ALL VALUES AND OTHER BY COUNT THE VALUES
# PRINT THE SUM AND THE COUNTABLE OF THE VALUES.
